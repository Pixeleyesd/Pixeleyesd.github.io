      You have 80 seconds to get the most points out of the two teams. You have to shoot and place shields in order to win. You set your stats / loadout on the iPhone on your wrist, or the external iPad / iDevice. To enter into the HADO game, press entry. If one of your teammates or opponents have loaded in, but you don't see their petals (the things you shoot to gain points) then you have to reset your AR. Press the now paler entry button to unload yourself from the game, then look at the opponents backdrop, and press AR reset (the blue button above the entry button). If there is no blue or red square around their backdrop, then you have to double-tap the home button on your headset and swipe up on the "HADO 3v3" application. You then reopen it, and ask someone to reconnect you using the host PC or laptop. You then press AR reset while looking at the opponent's backdrop, and then the red or blue square will outline the opponent's backdrop. You then reselect your stats / loadout, then press entry.

      <p><strong>Shoot energy balls</strong><br>To charge, hold your dominant arm up to your temple, and you should see the yellow bar increasing at the bottom. Once you have charged up at least one, although it is recommended to have at least three before firing, move your arm in a throwing motion to shoot the HADO energy balls, and aim for enemy "petals". Each kill adds a point to your team's overall points.</p>

      <p><strong>Place shields</strong><br>Shielding is a very important thing in HADO, especially if you are a shielder. In order to shield, you need to point your arm directly downwards, then once the green bar charges up fully, bring your arm up to place the shield. It is recommended to place the shield near the front, usually at the sides, unless the enemy team are doing that as well. If that is the case, and you are playing on a full size court, make sure to drop back and place a "defensive shield".</p>

      <p><strong>Roles</strong><br>There are three main roles in HADO; Sniper, Spammer, and Shielder. In order to change roles, you add different points to different properties. The first column is bullet speed, then bullet scale, then recharge speed, and lastly shield strength. The way you read out the different point columns are by listing the numbers to apply. For example, 3 2 4 1, with each number corresponding to the column of each stat. The sniper loadout for beginners is 3 4 2 1, with the experienced player loadout being 4 4 1 1, and if you have mastered this, then you can experiment with 3 5 1 1. The spammer loadout for all levels is 3 2 4 1, and the shielder loadout tends to be 1 1 3 5.</p>

      <p><strong>Spammer strategies</strong><br>If you choose the spammer loadout (3 2 4 1) then the main strategy is to charge up to full the moment the game starts. Once you have fully charged your bullets, then shoot one bullet at a time at the enemy team, and if the sniper says a player number, target that player, each time making sure that afterwards you wait for your charging bar to fill up again before doing the same again. If the opposing team has a shielder, then eventually they will place a shield. Once they do this, then you release all of your bullets, making sure you have a tiny break in between bullet shots to recharge just a tiny bit, in order to break the opposition's shields. You then repeat this for the rest of the game.</p>

    <div id="gearlist5">      
      <p><strong>Sniper strategies</strong><br>If you choose a sniper loadout (3 4 2 1, 4 4 1 1, or 3 5 1 1) then the strategy tends to be to charge up as soon as the game starts, and once you are at 3 or more charged up bullets, then you say which player number you are targeting. It is recommended to target the player in the opposite corner from you. The spammer will likely start shooting at that player to distract them, and then you shoot half of your bullets in quick succession, and if you miss, shoot the rest. When the shielder places a shield, go behind that shield and shoot two bullets at a time. Once that shield turns very opaque, you have to "bail". Bailing is when the shield turns very opaque due to the enemy bullets shooting at it, so you go back and start dodging again just before the shield breaks.</p>

      <p><strong>Shielder strategies</strong><br>If you have chosen the shielder loadout (usually 1 1 3 5), then the strategy is to place shields evenly throughout the duration of the game, stating whether you are charging a shield and where you are going to place it. It is recommended to place the shield near the front, usually at the sides, unless the enemy team are doing that as well. If that is the case, and you are playing on a full size court, make sure to drop back and place a "defensive shield". If you are playing at less then a full sized court, then just place a shield directly opposite the enemy shield. You and the spammer can then break the enemy shield, and the spammer and the sniper can shoot at the enemy team. After this, you will need to bail. You bail when the shield turns opaque due to the enemy bullets shooting at it, so you go back and start dodging again just before the shield breaks.</p>
