        HADO is a "technosport" that merges physical sports with esports.<br>
        HADO is a unique, augmented reality (AR) sport that combines physical movement with virtual gaming, where players wear head-mounted displays and armband sensors to throw energy balls, also known as bullets, and deploy shields on a real-world court. Players have to move their body to dodge the bullets and have to shoot down the opponents’ shields to hit the opposing team’s players that are behind it.

      If you want to host your own HADO game, you will need:

    <div id="gearlist1">
      <p><strong>A VR Headset or iPhone</strong><br>An AR-VR headset or a head-mounted phone allows the AR environment to connect to the host PC to play HADO. The cheapest and most lightweight option is an iPhone SE or any flagship iphone. HADO is usually iPhone based, so this is the best option. If you want to use other VR headsets, you will need to set up extra software for any other VR headsets to work with the HADO desktop software.</p>

      <p><strong>A HADO Wristband</strong><br>If you want to play HADO, then you will need a HADO wristband or "armband sensor" to detect the motion of your hand. There are multiple options for this, including strapping a phone to your wrist, or buying a dedicated armband sensor from a HADO store. The easiest way to get a HADO wristband is by strapping an old iphone to your wrist after downloading the HADO app.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="gearlist3">      
      <p><strong>A Gaming Laptop or PC</strong><br>If you want to host a game of HADO, you will need a host PC, which will have to process and run many tasks at once, so it is recommended to get a gaming laptop or PC if possible. It will be proccessing the HADO game, OBS studio for watching the live game (with AR overlay) if you want to, and all of the inputs being sent from the players.</p>

      <p><strong>(optional) an iPhone or Camera</strong><br>If you want to watch the HADO game with the AR overlay, you will need an iphone or a camera (e.g. a mirrorless or DSLR camera) with an iphone doing the post-proccessing for the AR overlay. In order to make this work, the easiest way is to use OBS Studio, so you can have the preview on a second monitor. An upside to using OBS Studio is that you can livestream or screen record your HADO game.</p>

    <h2>
      <br>
      Even though you can host games yourself, it is recommended to play HADO in a public HADO arena instead of hosting it yourself.
